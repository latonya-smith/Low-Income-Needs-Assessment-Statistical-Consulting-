# Low-Income-Needs-Assessment-Statistical-Consulting-

This project is the semester long project of my statistical consulting class. In this class the task is to use the data provided by the Rhode Island Public Health Institute (RIPHI) to provide aactionable insights through statistical analysis using R programming Language. The data was collected via a survey of the incoming patients from the 6 different locations in Rhode Island

Due to the nature of the alliance between Wesleyan University's Quantitative Analysis Center and this client, there are limits on the data that will be available to the public.
