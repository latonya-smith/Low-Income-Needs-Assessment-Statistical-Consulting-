# Low-Income-Needs-Assessment-Statistical-Consulting-

This project is the semester long project of my statistical consulting class. In this class the task is to use the data provided by the Rhode Island Public Health Institute (RIPHI) to provide aactionable insights through statistical analysis using R programming Language. Due to the nature of the alliance between Wesleyan University's Quantitative Analysis Center and this client, there will be limits on what may be available to the public.
